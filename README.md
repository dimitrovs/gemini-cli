Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. It provides lightweight access to Gemini, giving you the most direct path from your prompt to our model.

**Migration Notice:** This project is currently being migrated from NodeJS to Go. The original NodeJS application has been moved to the `legacy-nodejs` directory. This `README.md` describes the new Go-based Gemini CLI.
