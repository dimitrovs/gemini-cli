This is a migration project to Go. Your main goal is to migrate all the features from the Typescript CLI to the Go CLI.

The main directory for the Go project is `gemini-cli-go`. All the new code should be added to this directory.

The `README.md` file contains the migration plan. Refer to it to see the progress and the remaining tasks.

The migration should be done in small steps, and each step should be tested to ensure that it is working correctly.

The final goal is to have a fully functional Go CLI that has the same features as the Typescript CLI.

Run `go test ./...` to ensure all tests pass.
